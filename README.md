# MONGOOSE

This is a repository for people to share notes, notebooks, papers, and slides related to the MONGOOSE (dynamics) discussion group at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA).

For the purposes of this group, dynamics is very broad and covers anything related to phase space variables changing in time.

This includes (but is not limited to) topics in:

- analytic theory
- cosmology
- fluids
- galaxies
- numerics
- orbits
- planets
- resonance
- stars

The style of meetings is also very open. They range from blackboard style talks to interactive sessions and anything in between.

If there is a topic in dynamics that you would like to learn, please let me know and Iâ€™ll try to make it happen!
